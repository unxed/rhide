  This file describes how to compile the package for Win32 systems using
Microsoft Visual C compiler. Note that I don't have it and Microsoft doesn't
offer reduced versions for free like Borland does. For this reason this
target ever lags behind. I need volunteer to test this target periodically.
  Note: Some time after writing it Microsoft released a reduced and free
version of the compiler, but only for Windows 2000 and newer systems. I
don't have access to such a version of Windows.

1. INTRODUCTION

  This target is supported because users helped to make it possible. If you
find any problem just do the same the other users did: help to fix them.
  You can also create Win32 versions of this package using BorlandC Builder,
Cygwin, Open Watcom or MinGW.
  Versions 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 7.1 compiled the code.


2. HOW TO COMPILE

  You can use the unified make system:

nmake -f Makefile.nmk

  If it fails you can try using the old mechanism explained in
winnt/readme.txt


3. INSTALLATION

  Currently this target needs manual installation. You can also use the files
without installing just providing the paths to the compiler.
