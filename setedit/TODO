That's a list of things to do in the project:

* Navigate projects changing the working directory. It should use a stack of
current directories. Each time a subproject is opened the directory is changed
and the old pushed to the stack. When the project is closed a pop should
provide the previous dir and project. If the user breaks the chain by manually
opening another project the stack should by flushed.
  It will mostly help Windows users that likes to start an application from a
central icon and then choose the working dir.

* Add the TV templated suggested by JASC to simplify the code.

* Backwards search using a line by line aproach.

* Fix problems with the code pages in Windows versions. Reference report:
0001.txt.
* Check what can be removed from:
 SaveFontLoadedInfo(s);
 SavePaletteSystem(s);
 s << TScreen::screenMode;
 s << UseExternPrgForMode;
 s.writeString(ExternalPrgMode);
* Remove: TSetEditorApp::ExternalPrgMode, UseExternPrgForMode
* Clean code page and font code.
* Clean all preferences dialogs.
* Evaluate if the TTextPalette member should test Changed before calling the low level set.
