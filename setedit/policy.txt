This file contains some guidelines for myself (SET) or any other developer.

1. Adding a new file.
2. Removing a file.
3. Changing versions.


1. Adding a new file:
--------------------

* If the file is binary and cvs doesn't know it yet: add it in cvswrappers.
* Run "cvs add file" in the directory where the file is.
* Add the file to the "lista" file in the "makes" directory. Use '-' preffix
for binary files, '+' for files that need "chmod +x file" and '*' for files
that must be converted to DOS format while passing from unix to dos (.bat, a
copyright file or some readme.1st).
* Add it to the right .gpr file. Remmember:
  Is this file dependant of FOR_LIBSET? If yes: Is in gpr included by
libset.gpr?
* Add the file to libset.gpr if it will be needed by RHIDE.


2. Removing a file:
------------------

* Delete the file.
* Run "cvs remove file".
* Remove the name from the:
  gpr
  libset.gpr
  lista
  listaxtr


3. Changing versions:
--------------------

* Change ./version.txt and include/ced_inte.h
* The debian stuff is automatically changed by the scripts and Ivan changes
it as soon as I put the changes in the CVS.
