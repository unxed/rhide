<a name="intro"></a>
InfView is an easy to use info viwer. The command line have the most relevant
options provided by info and the user interface is much more intuitive. It
makes InfView a good replacement for the info-stantalone program. The main
objetive of InfView is to give to the user a friendly and easy to learn tool
to browse the documentation found in info format. This format is used by the
FSF for all the major tools and of course is used by djgpp.<p>
The old info program was designed as a flexible UNIX tool so it have some
features you won't find in InfView, as an example: InfView doesn't have
options to write a documentation chapter to the standard output so you can
capture it and display in other program. InfView was designed as an
interactive tool instead.<p>
InfView uses overlapping windows (real windows, not "screens"), fully
supports mouse, have pull-down menues and pop-up windows, etc. As the name
says the emphasis is in the visual component.<p>
Unless graphical implementations the program is relative small and quite
fast (263Kb installation for the first release, I know about one Win32
implementation that needs over 5Mb and eats more than 5Mb of memory thanks to
the run time of some visual script language from Redmond that I won't name
here).<p>
I started to develop InfView in 1996 to add help to
<a href="http://www.rhide.com/" target="_top">RHIDE</a>. It was a
big step for RHIDE. My next contribution was a text editor. Currently the
editor is also distributed as an standalone program and of course have InfView
as help system. I created a standalone InfView because many users asked for
it. The advantages of an standalone program are:

<ul>
 <li> Smaller memory requirements.
 <li> Specialized command line.
 <li> Specialized menues.
 <li> Specialized features (example: InfView windows are tileable).
</ul>

<a name="features"></a>
The main features of InfView are:

<ul>
 <li> Free cursor movement with the keyboard arrows, page-up, etc.
 <li> Mouse support.
 <li> Highlighted cross references.
 <li> Hide of the `*Note' and other confusing things of the info format.
 <li> Previous, Next and Up node support.
 <li> History support.
 <li> Incremental search just typing the first letters of the cross reference.
 <li> The same for the whole nodes list.
 <li> Support for compressed info files.
 <li> Search in the current node, the whole file or all the files.
 <li> Bookmarks.
 <li> History of the last 40 nodes visited.
 <li> Dialog to browse the files on disk.
 <li> info like command line for people already acustomed to info.
 <li> Many overlapping windows containing different info files can be opened at the same time. Only limited by available memory.
 <li> and more
</ul>

<tr BGCOLOR="#80A0FF"><td>
InfView is distributed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" target="_top">GPL</a>
license. It basically means the code is free and you don't need to pay for it
and you are free to change it, but any derived work will become GPL too. Most
of the software available for Linux is distributed under these terms. This
license protects my rights over the code (I hold the copyright) and protects
the users ensuring they are free to use the code. If you plan to use parts or
the whole code of InfView be sure you read the GPL license carefully.<br>
Note that GPL implies a disclaimer of guaranty, so if you must use it in an
enterprise where you need to be able to sue software's authors in case of
direct or indirect problems created by it just forget about InfView. By
the way, I don't know about even one big company (Microsoft included) that doesn't
included a disclaim of guaranty in your license.<br>
Even when you don't need to pay for InfView I accept any kind of help ;-).
The best way to help me is contributing in one of the ways I mention

There are a lot of ways you can contribute, here are some of them:<p>

<ul>
<li> Giving useful bug reports, it means providing a good description of the
     bug and how to reproduce it.
<li> Writing examples of use or <i>mini-howto</i>s. I'll be glad to include
     them with InfView.
<li> Helping with the web pages.
<li> Helping with the distribution, e.g. if you have an internet host or you
     can help with the announcements and uploads.
<li> Packaging InfView.
<li> Porting the code to other platforms. Currently
     <a href="mailto:zager@post.comstar.ru">Dim Zegebart</a> is helping with the
     Alpha/Linux platform.
<li> Helping with the internationalization. Even when my language is spanish
     InfView have documentation and messages only in english, it means I
     don't even have time to keep upto date the support for my own language.
<li> Making additions to the code.
<li> Sending a post card from your city or some of the things I collect
     (train tickets, cigarette envelopes and boxes, stamps, old money and
     coins) you'll help to keep my interest in the project.
<li> Of course I'll accept money from you or any hardware, but I know that's
     very hard for most people, specially because I'm in Argentina.
</ul>
