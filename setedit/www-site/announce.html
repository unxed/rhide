<HTML><Title>announce for setedit</Title><Body><Pre>That's the announcement that I released the SET's editor Glaciar P.Moreno I release
(v0.5.4):

What's SET's editor?

  SETEdit or setedit or SET's editor is a text mode oriented text editor
with the look & feel of the old Borland's IDE. It have windows that can be
overlapped, common widgets (buttons, menues, check and radio buttons,
etc.), mouse support and old the funny things you usually find in a GUI
editor (even when all is in text mode).
  The editor is mainly oriented for programmers because it have tons of
tools that helps writing programs, specially C/C++, but suitable to edit
any kind of text file. In fact the code page and fonts handling options
make it very suitable to edit text in different encodings and convert it
back and forth from one encoding to another. Some nice widgets like
graphical screen savers and MP3 player also makes the editor a funny
environment.
  For those who know about RHIDE: setedit is the same editor you can find
inside RHIDE but without the IDE itself, as it's the last version have more
features (and bugs?, I hope it have less ;-), seriously, I killed a huge
number of bugs most small but some very annoying).
  Is also true that some features takes a lot of time to be incorporated to
RHIDE or just won't be incorporated to RHIDE at all. The standalone editor
is also very suitable to be used for the parts of your project that are
handled with makefiles.

Main features:
* Easy to use for DOS users because have a lot of CUA and Wordstar commands
used in the editors of other compilers.
* Full configurable keyboard.
* Full configurable menu (OS dependent features and macros in menues).
* Advanced features: Rectangular blocks, intelligent indent, configurable
syntax highlight and more.
* Simple macro language, will be expanded only if the people is interested
and helps a bit (which is starting to happend).
* PMacros for fast writing.
* Real macros.
* Debugger interface (only for Linux).
* Documentation tool for libraries or large projects.
* Fonts, code pages, screen modes and palette customization.
* You can run make or grep from the editor collecting the errors/hints.
* Clock and screen saver.
* Linux and Win32 versions (FreeBSD, QNX and Solaris also supported).

Why I could want to download it if RHIDE exists?

  The editor is the newest version v0.5.4 and have a lot of differences with
the one included in RHIDE 1.4 (v0.3.6). Attention! Robert released a new
beta of RHIDE (1.4.9) containing one of the newest editors.
  Here are some of the reasons you could have:

1) You like the editor and want to use it without needing to start the whole
IDE. The editor have a half of the size of RHIDE mainly because GDB isn't
inside of the editor. I use my editor to edit all the files I create ;-).
2) You are a RHIDE fanatic and want to test the new features or check if
some bug was killed.
3) You are a djgpp fanatic and want to collect anything made with djgpp (I'm
one of these crazy mans ;-).
4) You don't like RHIDE at all, you think it sucks, but you think you can
help to make it a really good thing.

...

Ok, where can I get it?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[66 new things and 40 fixes]

New [66 things]:

+ Debug [12] --&gt; NEW Functionality for *Linux* &lt;--

* Dialogs to configure the debug mode (local, remote and running process), the
command line options for the program, gdb binary, xterm binary, messages
displayed, etc.
* Breakpoints, simple ones and advanced options including conditional
breakpoints, breakpoints at functions, ignore count, etc.
* Watchpoints, they are data breakpoints.
* Options to run, continue, step over, trace into, run upto return, etc.
* Options to stop and kill the program.
* Thread selection.
* Evaluate and modify data.
* Data Window and Satck to browse the memory (very complete and with its own
menu).
* Data Watches, like then ones in RHIDE and also with scope.
* Data Inspectors, used to analyze complex data structures.
* Disassembler Window, including syntax highlight and allowing to modify the
registers.
* Calling stack, with functionality to browse the call chain.

+ Various [15]

* Alternative project sorting mode.
* Commands to select any window, now Alt+Key is no longer hardcoded.
* Sections in the docs to help finding what you need.
* When asking for word completion if the word at the left looks like Class::
then the editor looks for the class and offers the members.
* Enhacements to the "Paste Emacs Mode" and the code to search Emacs
variables.
* Now if you don't specify any path to "search files under cursor" the editor
tries to automagically fills this list using the output of cpp.
* If the editor fails to find the file under cursor now it also looks for it
in the project and the current directory.
* Some rudimentary $(VARIABLE) expansion to the "File under cursor" files
list.
* A button to recompute window numbers in the list of windows.
* "File open" dialogs remmembers its size and position.
* Non interactive versions of the cmcExpandAllTabs and cmcCompactBuffer
commands to be used from sLisp.
* Two new commands: cmeGPushCursorPos and cmeGPopCursorPos. They are "global
push/pop cursor pos". So they also remmember the file.
* Options to zoom the editor windows when inserted in the desktop.
* An option to regenerate the central tags file. Used to workaround ctags bug.
* Modified behavior of the paste operation in input lines: Now the text is
pasted without destroying the previous value (unless it is selected).

+ Menu files [4]

* Context sensitive menues. Also extended the .smn file language to create
such a thing. Currently used only for the data window and the help.
* The conditionals in menu files can use the TV driver, CPU, OS, etc. for
conditions.
* More variables to check: MP3, PCRE, BZIP2, MIXER and UNIX.
* $define and $undef and its expansion.

+ Compilation [2]

* The posibility to override the "install" command in makefiles.
* Unified compilation mechanism for BC++.

+ sLisp [9]

* FindString, FindAgain, ReplaceString and ReplaceAgain for searches.
* SelectWindowNumber used to change the focused window.
* GetCurWindowNumber and GetMaxWindowNumber.
* You can bind small portions of sLisp code to keys and menu entries.
* KeyBindings and BindKey commands. With them you can change key bindings
from sLisp.
* prex to perform Perl regular expressions searches.
* GetSystemInfo to know the current OS, TV driver, CPU, etc.
* More macros examples.
* Now you can send cme* commands.

+ Syntax highlight and pmacros [8]

* Flat Assembler syntax.
* Ruby syntax.
* SPARC assembler syntax.
* WML syntax and pmacros.
* Errors parser for Perl.
* C,H and CPP as valid C extensions as valid for C/C++.
* HTML extensions as valid for HTML.
* vbe and vst as VHDL extensions.

+ Cosmetic [16]

* Project windows are "closed" (hided) when pressing ESC.
* Windows are opened "zoomed" when the project window isn't visible.
* When automatically opening a project item now its opened using the relative
path.
* Select the closest word when using double click and not the next.
* History to the "arbitrary indent" and "run command" input lines.
* To lock the screen while doing a search & replace operation to avoid
"flashing" when doing a lot of S&R operations.
* Modified: "Do not purge spaces" option to be "Keep trailing whitespace"
that's more descriptive.
* A new color scheme called "Classic Borland"
* A new color scheme called "Midnight Commander"
* If the Ctrl+Enter fails to find the file under cursor now that's informed
in the "status line" of the current editor.
* Most lists (like functions list) now centers the focused item when a match
is selected.
* OS/OS flavor,CPU,Compiler/Compiler flavor and Driver to the about box.
* Configuration options to disable the calculator and calendar.
* Now the meassure command reports the result in the status line.
* A beep when "Run a program" finishes. Option to disable.
* Busy indicator while we load the tags from disk.


Fixed [40 things]:

+ Fatal  [4]

* The "Jump" button in the main window of the class browser.
* Undo count for the first undo wasn't initialized. Unknown consequence.
* Corrupted MP3 files could produce a crash.
* Abort when doing word completion and the starting word was "bigger" than
the last tag in the list.

+ Not fatal [17]

* HTML export: missing body tag.
* Errors in the conditionals parser for menu files.
* Undo error when a character replaced a tab (overwrite enabled) and the
cursor was inside the tab (not at the beggining).
* Wrong match pair when the cursor was in the middle of a tab and the next
character matched a pair (highlight in the middle of the tab).
* No match pair after deleting some text and the cursor goes to a symbol.
* When searching outside comments and the match was found in the first column
of a line after a comment it was ignored.
* When starting a project using a different window size the project window
could get wrong size and even become outside the screen.
* When aborting an overwrite (in save as) the name of the window was changed.
* When pasting using the OS clipboard and the cursor was moved to the end of
the selection it could go out of screen which is quite annoying.
* When copying something from the calculator and the paste wasn't enabled
before entering the calculator then you needed to at least move the cursor
before you could paste.
* Use of unitialized undo counter in some rectangular selection operations.
* The heuristic C/C++ parser to support list of exceptions (function
throw(...) {body}).
* Some details in the heuristic C++ functions searcher. They address problems
with the const and throw() attributes.
* Various memory leaks.
* "New" buffers shouldn't be added to the list of closed windows when closed.
It generated a read out of bounds and a write of unitialized data to disk.
* The menu files uses nested preprocessor directives but it wasn't supported.
* cmcCutClipWin command not dis/enabled when selecting text.

+ Compilation [13]

* Cygwin: Collision between strndup and calculator parser.
* Some gcc versions needs explicit use of libstdc++ to link C++ and
internac/getcolors didn't have it.
* Removed two comments containing non-ASCII chars.
* Various gcc 3.x compilation issues (including gcc 3.4.1 support).
* Problems with newer versions of makeinfo.
* The memcpy usage to be more portable. It worked for all supported targets,
but now should also work for unsupported targets. Same for malloc/new/new[]
v.s. free/delete/delete[] calls.
* Missing va_end and abuse of va_list type. It gave problems for Linux PPC
targets.
* Use of "g++" in favor of "gcc -lstdc++".
* strstr and strchr are declared different in C++ standard (compared to C
standard). Needed to avoid BC++ compilation problems.
* Various MSVC compilation issues.
* --cxx-flags flag was reported as --cpp-flags in the help. Now both are
valid.
* Cygwin can execute the "make install" target, but it installed binaries
without .exe extension.
* Detection of pcre header for systems where the header is in pcre/pcre.h.
Red Hat is an example.

+ Linux [3]

* Code page problems when mixing console use and remote XTerm use.
* RPM prereq for /sbin/install-info.
* Problems to create the rpms using Fedora Core 2.

+ Cosmetic [3]

* Some drawing variables not initialized. Could make the row/col cursor
appear until a new redraw.
* Now the cmc*Win (Copy,Cut,Paste) commands are called cmc*OS to reflect
their real use. The old names remains as aliases.
* The list for word completion had a wrong vertical size when we had repeated
tags in the list to choose. Only one was visible but the size was computed
counting the repetitions.
