Setedit-Cygwin_install-HOWTO
for setedit-Win32-Cygwin-0_4_54 (unstable)


INTRODUCTION

This is just a kind of log of activities I did to get a running version
of Setedit under my installation of Cygwin. So, if you find it useful
for your own needs - that's great!

The original home page for Setedit is:
http://setedit.sourceforge.net


BACKGROUND

Right now (as of May 2002), there are two ready to use versions of
Setedit: one is for DJGPP/DOS and second is for GNU/Linux. For Cygwin
there is only an executable of Setedit without any accompanying files.

Since Cygwin is a quite fine port of GNU tools onto the Win32 platform,
I suggest to start with Linux version of Setedit. Then just merge most
of its files with Cygwin installation and put the mentioned executable
into Cygwin's /usr/bin.


DOWNLOAD

First of all, you need two things.

Linux version of Setedit:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/setedit/setedit-0.4.54.bin.i386.elf.static.linux.tar.gz

Cygwin executable of Setedit:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/setedit/setedit-Win32-Cygwin-0_4_54.zip

Eventually, it's possible to use executable produced by free BC++ 5.5
compiler. It may work fine for you, but we are concerned here with
running a Cygwin version of Setedit, right? :-)


HOW TO DO IT

The idea is to use uncompressed version from home directory and to
merge most of files from there with current installation of Cygwin.

And now step by step instructions.


STEP 1.
Put the 'setedit-0.4.54.bin.i386.elf.static.linux.tar.gz' and
'setedit-Win32-Cygwin-0_4_54.zip' files in home directory. Then
execute the following command:

$ tar -xzf setedit-0.4.54.bin.i386.elf.static.linux.tar.gz

This in an effect should create a subdirectory 'setedit-0.4.54'.


STEP 2.
Merge (install) the Setedit files by executing following commands:

$ cd setedit-0.4.54
$ ./INSTALL.LINUX

This will install Setedit as it would under GNU/Linux. But for Cygwin
it's not yet useful! Proceed to STEP 3 to complete installation.

Note 1:
 The above worked for me well. If you want to check what will
 be done, or to have a detailed log of the actions undertaken by
 the INSTALL.LINUX script, you may try one of the following:

* just print the commands, but don't execute them:
 $ ./INSTALL.LINUX -n

* install Setedit also creating an installation log:
 ./INSTALL.LINUX | tee ~/setedit-install.log

Note 2:
 All the files which should go to the Cygwin's /usr/bin directory
 are really placed in the /bin dir (easily seen in e.g. Windows
 Explorer), and /usr/bin stays empty all the time -- for some reason,
 which only people at Cygnus know. Anyway, I can live with it.


STEP 3.
Now one of the most important things - extract and copy Setedit for
Cygwin executable instead of Linux version:

$ rm /usr/bin/setedit
$ unzip setedit-Win32-Cygwin-0_4_54.zip
$ mv seteditW32.exe /usr/bin/setedit.exe


STEP 4.
Finally - polishing the Setedit installation.

If you installed 'texinfo' under Cygwin, it will not read gzipped info
files by default. It's possible to mess a little with configuration of
info itself, but easier way is to gunzip Setedit info files by hand:

$ gunzip /usr/info/infview.info.gz
$ gunzip /usr/info/sdg.info.gz
$ gunzip /usr/info/setedit.info.gz

Almost the same stands for man page for Setedit, but this time man *do*
reads the gzipped man pages by default. Anyway, for completness, man
page may be also gunzipped (note this is not necessary):

$ gunzip /usr/man/man1/setedit.1.gz

If you didn't install XFree86 under Cygwin (which I didn't) or do not
intend to use 'eterm' (which I don't), then you may freely remove
the following directory:

$ rm -rf /usr/share/setedit/eterm


FINAL WORDS

The above procedure should give you a working installation of Setedit
under Cygwin. But 'working' and 'well-working' are not (yet) the same.
