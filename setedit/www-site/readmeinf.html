1. INTRODUCTION

  InfView is a good replacement for the info-stantalone program. The main
objetive of InfView is to give to the user a friendly and easy to learn tool
to browse the documentation found in info format. This format is used by the
FSF for all the major tools and of course is used by djgpp.
  The old info program was designed as a flexible UNIX tool so it have some
features you won't find in InfView, as an example: InfView doesn't have
options to write a documentation chapter to the standard output so you can
capture it and display in other program. InfView was designed as an
interactive tool instead.
  InfView uses overlapping windows (real windows, not "screens"), fully
supports mouse, have pull-down menues and pop-up windows, etc. As the name
says the emphasis is in the visual component.
  Unless graphical implementations the program is relative small and quite
fast (263Kb installation for the first release, I know about one Win32
implementation that needs over 5Mb and eats more than 5Mb of memory thanks to
the run time of some visual script language from Redmond that I won't name
here).
  The main features of InfView are:

   * Free cursor movement with the keyboard arrows, page-up, etc.
   * Mouse support.
   * Highlighted cross references.
   * Hide of the `*Note' and other confusing things of the info format.
   * Previous, Next and Up node support.
   * History support.
   * Incremental search just typing the first letters of the cross
     reference.
   * The same for the whole nodes list.
   * Support for compressed info files.
   * Search in the current node, the whole file or all the files.
   * Bookmarks.
   * History of the last 40 nodes visited.
   * Dialog to browse the files on disk.
   * and more



2. IMPORTANT:

  If you are a user of SETEdit you'll find this distribution very familiar
and in fact follows the same gidelines used in the editor's distribution.
  Changes since 0.2.6 release:

Additions:
  The last important addition was the man pages viewer.
  Now is possible to use File|Open Infview if no window is already opened.
  Added a configuration dialog to set the code page used by the OS screen.
  Internationalization, currently only spanish is fully soported.

Fixes:
  Now all options not available when no window is opened are grayed.
  The "Shell" menu option wasn't functional.


3. REQUIREMENTS:

* PC 386 compatible or superior computer.
* 2 Mb of memory or more.
* 2.4 Mb of free disk during installation and about 1.5 Mb once installed.
* DOS version 5.0 or posterior or any compatible OS (Win '95, Win 3.1, OS/2,
MS-DOS, etc.). The NT platform isn't fully supported, I don't have NT, if you
need support for NT send me a licensed copy of NT ;-). I did my best to
support it, but as I don't have one at home I can't do more.
* Linux with ELF support for the Linux version. For console use you need gpm
1.13, newer versions are incompatible.
* A VGA card.
* DJGPP users normally have it.



4. INSTALL:

A) Installing in DOS for djgpp users:
   Uncompress the file over your djgpp installation in the same way you did
   with the rest of packages.

C) Installing in Linux:
1) Uncompress the files in /tmp and run ./INSTALL_LINUX. If you want to setup
   the destination directory read the INSTALL_LINUX script.
   Also: the script contains useful information about access rights needed
   to run infview.
2) Be sure the directory where infview's binary file is located is included
   in your PATH environment variable.



5. LEGAL ISSUE:

  InfView is free software.  It may be used or distributed in any manner
you wish, as long as you do not violate the GPL license.  You can't remove
any copyrigth included in the files and you can't distribute it without any
of the original files. You will also distribute the sources if you distribute
the binaries. The GPL license is included in the package so read it before
distributing infview.

  InfView comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; excluding any and all implied
warranties, including warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
particular purpose.  There is no warranty or representation, either express
or implied, with respect to this program, its quality, performance,
merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.  The entire risk
of using this program is with you.  There will be no liability for special,
incidental, or consequential damages arising out of or resulting from the use
or modification of this program.



6. WHERE ARE THE SOURCES?

  Even when I'm distributing the standalone InfView I don't the time,
bandwidth, motivation, etc. to distribute yet another huge package of
sources. For this reason the sources are only available in the editor's
package (SETEdit). So download the editor's source. 90% of the code is shared
with the editor.

8. MAILING LIST

 The editor's list is more than suitable to discuse things related to the
InfView program because it is part of the editor:
