  This directory contains the files needed to create the Windows NT version
of SETEdit.
  Most of the work of this port was done by Anatoli Soltan <anatoli@iname.com>
  This readme is temporary.
  Here is a modified version of the text he sent me (updated by me):

Compiler:
---------
I used Borland C++ Builder 5 for debugging.  If you do not have it
you can use the free Borland command line tools that can be downloaded
from Borland's web site. They include Borland C++ 5.5 compiler that is the
same as in Builder 5.
Porting to Visual C++ and mingw32 can be trivial.
[SET Note: I used the free command line tools]

Versions:
---------
Linux versions of TurboVision and SETEDIT were used:
	TurboVision 1.0.10
	SETEDIT     0.4.41
[SET Note: I merged the code with 1.0.11 and 0.4.44]

Brief compilation instructions:
-------------------------------
Be sure Turbo Vision is installed and compiled in the ../../tvision
directory.
Just run make in this directory.
  
Known problems:
---------------
- Installation program has not been ported.
- Sound support has not been ported.

Additionally:
_____________
To reconfigure the make files you need Perl. The script is located in the
root directory of the distribution. Run "perl confignt.pl --help" to get
help.
